# Color-Flipper

## Description
This is a web page that lets its user to, if they want, click one of two buttons to change its background color to one of their choice or to a random one.

## How to execute and use it on your computer.
It can accessed in the link https://viniciusleitedocarmo.github.io/Color-Flipper/ through GitHub Pages.
Another way to do it is by downloading this repository's zip, extracting it, then opening the extracted folder "Color-Flipper-master" in your terminal and, with npm live-server installed, running the command "live-server". A page should automatically open showing the application or, if not, it should be accessible through a browser in the link: http://127.0.0.1:8080/, or with another number instead of this 8080 if you have settled some other for npm live-server.

**Thanks for taking your time to give it a try.**
